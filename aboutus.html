<h1 align="center">OUR INSPIRATION</h1>

Former minister, the Pioneer of Socio-economic transformation Late Shankarraoji Kolhe Saheb established Sanjivani Rural Education Society, Kopargaon in the year 1983 and started Sanjivani K. B. P. Polytechnic in the year 1982 and Sanjivani College of Engineering in the year 1983 with the view to impart technical education to the rural masses. The miracle took place many wards of farmers, workers, common people became the engineers and became self-reliant.

With passage of time, to cope up with the demand of the people, he started pharmacy, MBA, and many more institutes having the world-class infrastructure and standards.

 40 years back, he dreamed the vision to inculcate the skills and talents in the rural students so that they can face any kind of challenge across which they will come in the globe. And, it came really in existence that thousands of students from rural area got placed in multinational companies, some became government officers, some become entrepreneurs and some are shouldering the higher positions across the globe. Many students are going to pursue their MS in the leading universities of foreign countries and some are going for internship, that too on scholarship. Such a visionary person has led Kopargaon town on educational map of the country.<br/>
