        <h3>Profile:</h3>
        <p>Sanjivani College of Engineering has a legacy to provide best in engineering education since 1983. A strong industry connect , alumina , futuristic cognitive skill demand of industry 4.0, robotics, IoT, AI, automotive automation and home appliance automation suggest a scope 
            of ‘Mechatronics’ in engineering education. Sanjivani college of engineering understand this industrial and societal demand of automation and forward a step ahead with a new beginning of ‘Mechatronics’ branch in engineering from 2020-21.</p>
        <p>‘Mechatronics’ is a synergic integration of Computer science,  Mechanical , Electrical, & control engineering.</p>
        <p>Mechatronics engineer can do quite a bit across multiple engineering disciplines and have a solid base from which to grow & supersede in carrier. Mechatronics engineer know mechanical/electrical engineering, control and computer engineering fundamentals—they speak creative 
            smart solutions and languages—so a mechatronics engineer can perform extremely brilliant in research, industry, & software.</p>
        <p>The programme focuses on project base cognitive skill learning process.</p>
        <h3>HOD's Desk:</h3>
        <p>Welcome to an exciting filed of ‘Mechatronics’ – a branch of engineering. Sanjivani always spread a virtue of excellence as a legacy in engineering education. Future demand of industry 4.0, automation in diversified domains and simple but smart solutions to complexities forced 
            to imbibe new multidisciplinary competencies in engineers. The mechatronics department cater all these new required skill attributes in an engineer from 2020-21 in Sanjivani College of engineering of Savitribai Phule Pune University to cope up with Sanjivani’s legacy of Excellence 
            in engineering education. It is newly evolved branch with academic autonomy comprehension on dynamic requirement & necessary attributes of core technical skills in Robotics, IoT, artificial intelligence, Industry 4.0, automotive automation, home appliance automation, and drone technology.</p>
        <p>I appeal to all passionate learners, join the mechatronics department and make your dreams true, find the success in life and satisfy the thrust of new edge technology knowledge of 21 century. </p>
