      It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Sanjivani College of Engineering, Kopargaon, which is one of the premier Technical institutions of Maharashtra. Established in 1983 the Department has grown significantly over the years and currently offers degrees in UG [180 Intake], PG and Ph.D. Also Department is accredited by NAAC and has also been acknowledged by various renowned agencies. Our institute has academic autonomy [from 2019] enabling us to develop our own industry oriented and dynamic curriculum.

       To keep pace with the evolving technology, there is an increasing demand for engineers who are good at creative and logical thinking, analytical skills and are versatile. To meet this demand, the department grooms students to excel in the field of technology which aims to produce multi-faceted engineers. Our motto is to upgrade skills and knowledge of   young engineers to enable them to survive in the competitive world and hence they are always encouraged to participate in various technical and extra-curricular events.

      To groom students on various fronts, the department has well-qualified [with 12 Doctorates], trained and committed faculty members to improve knowledge, skills and attitude of the students by evoking required expertise from industries. We provide good technical support and give individual attention to all the students through mentoring system. Department has the best track record of good results. So far, 16 students have secured place among top 10 ranks under Savitribai Phule Pune University. Department is actively holding numerous value-added programs to develop technical skills and expertise of students.

            I hope and feel confident that our students, with their broad exposure to academic and professional fields, will leave mark wherever they go, nationally or globally. 

            We continue on this journey with our commitment to excellence. We welcome you to our Department and would like to be part of your success.
